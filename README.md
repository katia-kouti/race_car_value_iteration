# race_car_value_iteration
A grid-based simulation of a race car using value iteration for optimal policy determination.

The environment includes walls, start positions, and end points, with velocity constraints and rewards/penalties based on the car's movement. The algorithm calculates the best action policy for each state to minimize the cost of reaching the end. The project also includes route visualization and performance evaluation based on state transitions and rewards.
